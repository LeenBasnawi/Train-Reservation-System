# Train-Reservation-System using linkedlist
## project of Datastructure
A Train Reservation System is an online software application that enables users to book train tickets, offering features like schedule search, seat availability check, reservation.

Implementing a Linked List data structure in the system proves beneficial for managing available seats on each train. Each node in the Linked List represents a train seat, storing information such as seat number, availability status, passenger name, and booking details.

When users search for seats, the system traverses the Linked List to display available options. During reservations, the Linked List is updated by marking the reserved seat as unavailable and storing passenger information in the corresponding node.

Utilizing a Linked List for seat reservations provides advantages such as efficient node insertion and deletion for booked or canceled seats. It also offers flexibility by dynamically allocating memory for new reservations without requiring pre-allocation of a fixed-size array.

In summary, integrating a Linked List data structure in a Train Reservation System streamlines seat reservation management, providing an efficient approach for handling booking transactions.
